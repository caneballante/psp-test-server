    "progress-description": "Marine Water Condition Index scores have generally declined over the long-term, indicating that marine water quality continues to diminish.~SL Index scores in Bellingham Bay, Sinclair Inlet, Budd Inlet and Whidbey Basin have declined continuously relative to the baseline time period from 1999-2008. Other regions decreased, but not as consistently.~B Unfavorable ocean conditions in 2015 and 2016 in the Salish Sea and off the west coast of Washington have contributed to the apparent decline in water quality across all regions.~EL",
	"what": "The Marine Water Condition Index measures changes in water quality that are relevant to eutrophication against a baseline reference period. The index integrates 12 variables that each describe an important aspect of water quality, such as temperature, salinity, nutrient balance, algae biomass, and dissolved oxygen in surface water 0-50 meters. The baseline is calculated for the time period 1999 – 2008. Positive values of the index indicate relatively improved marine water quality, and negative values indicate worse marine water quality relative to the baseline.~P The Marine Water Condition Index provides a framework that links changes in water quality and physical conditions in Puget Sound to the larger context of influencing factors of oceanic water quality and climate. The Marine Water Condition Index detects changes in water conditions against site and seasonal-specific baseline conditions with a focus on change rather than an absolute quality. The index reports on a scale of +50 to -50 indicating a complete positive or negative departure from baseline conditions, with zero indicating unchanged conditions relative to the baseline. The index is reported for 12 regions using 27 monthly sampled monitoring stations.",

Yellow shows scores between -2 and 2, representing little to no change. The maximal range of the index scores spans from -50 to +50, indicating that monthly measured variables are falling either exclusively above or below the expected baseline.",

			"description" : "The decline in the Marine Water Condition Index is illustrated in Table 1 showing 1) a shift in the past 19 years from green in the early years to shades of orange and red in the later years, and 2) more negative scores. These results show that conditions are drifting in the direction of lower water quality. The greatest change in index score values over 19 years occurred in Bellingham Bay (21% decline), followed by Sinclair Inlet (19% decline). Water Condition Index scores have also declined significantly in Budd Inlet, Whidbey Basin and Oakland Bay (>15% decline), while Oakland Bay water quality was already low in 1999.  Recently, unfavorable ocean conditions in 2015 and 2016 in the Salish Sea and off the west coast of Washington have contributed to the apparent decline in water quality across all regions.~P Marine water quality patterns in Puget Sound vary over time in response to large climate variations and may be best described by periods of consecutive years when water quality is better than average, and periods when water quality is lower than average (e.g. 2003-2006). However, despite these fluctuations, trends emerge over time. For instance, index scores in Bellingham Bay, Sinclair Inlet, Whidbey Basin and Budd Inlet have been significantly declining over the last nineteen years. Other regions decreased, but not as consistently."

	"why-happening": "There are two dominant sources of nutrients entering Puget Sound: input from ocean waters and inputs from land, which includes human sources of pollution. Until 2012, the largest driver of declining marine water quality was an increase in nitrate concentrations. Because nitrate is an important plant nutrient, increasing nitrate loads can fuel algae blooms and shift species. As large masses of algae die, they sink and decay, and dissolved oxygen is depleted. Bellingham Bay, Sinclair Inlet and Oakland Bay stand out because of changes in the nutrient balance. ~P Since 2013 however, nitrate levels in Puget Sound have declined. This likely happened due to climate variations that decreased the nutrient inputs from the ocean. Despite removing the large contributions of nutrients from the ocean using the Enrichment Module of the Index, nitrate levels in Puget Sound continue to increase. This means that nitrogen inputs from land have continued to increase despite large fluctuations in nitrogen loadings from the ocean. ~P How can this be? Water exchange between the ocean and Puget Sound is important for water quality. Incoming ocean water imports a lot of natural upwelled nitrogen from the ocean which has beneficial nutrient composition and cold temperatures to promote a diatom based food web in Puget Sound. However, if renewal is sluggish in years of summer drought, nutrient inputs from humans begin to play a bigger role. During the Blob, El Niño and recent summer droughts we learned a lot about the effects of sluggish water exchange. ~P Aerial photographs taken over Puget Sound showed abundant eutrophication indicators at the surface that are not captured by the Marine Water Condition Index, such as the presence of Noctiluca and other red dinoflagellate blooms, macro-algae and floating jellyfish. What caused this? The impact of nutrients from wastewater in Puget Sound during the summer is significant and drought conditions increase this impact. Different nutrient inputs and warm water shift the lower food web from a diatom based food web rich in lipids that support cold-water fish, towards a microbial food web, supporting many species that contain little oil and macro-algae that do not fuel the planktonic food web. In turn, these organic eutrophication indicators are highly visible, wash up on beaches and decay, a topic that requires greater focus and attention on how we assess human impacts in the future. For more information about the impact of human activities on oxygen in Puget Sound, see the “dissolved oxygen” indicator.~P In conclusion, frequent summer droughts as we have seen in recent years can reduce the nutrient loading from the ocean, yet under these conditions water stays longer in Puget Sound and human impacts are more pronounced, the marine food web responds, and visible eutrophication indicators are abundant.",
