		"progress-description": "Between 2004 and 2018, there was no upward or downward trend in this indicator. Thus, progress is categorized as 'not improving'.~SL Since 2004, soon after the program started, many local bacteria problems have been identified and corrected. There are year-to-year fluctuations in marine water quality at swimming beaches, but no clear trend in progress toward the goal.~B Although the majority of monitored swimming beaches have met EPA standards for enterococci fecal bacteria, the target of 100% has not been met to date.~EL",
		"what": "The condition of swimming beaches indicator reflects marine water quality conditions in areas heavily used for recreation. Swimming beaches not meeting water quality criteria indicate increased risk of people getting sick through gastrointestinal illnesses, respiratory illnesses, and skin infections.~P Washington’s BEACH Program was launched in 2003 in response to the BEACH Act, which amended the U.S. Clean Water Act in 2000. A collaboration between the Department of Ecology, Department of Health and local health jurisdictions, and Tribes, the program monitors high-use/high-risk beaches throughout the Puget Sound and Washington’s coast.~P The number of monitored beaches varies from year to year depending on availability of funding and where water quality issues arise. A subset of beaches are sampled every year and are called the “core” beaches.~P For this indicator, a beach that passes swimming standards means there is no more than one swimming advisory or closure during the summer. A swimming advisory is issued if bacteria levels are greater than 104 enterococcus/100mL, and a swimming closure is issued if bacteria levels are greater than 276 enterococcus/100mL.",

		"why-happening": "Most swimming beaches in Puget Sound have good water quality. Bacteria problems arise from faulty septic tanks, sewage spills, stormwater, and animal waste, including pet waste, farm animals, and wildlife. The source of contamination is different from beach to beach and is not always obvious.~P Water quality results fluctuate from year-to-year. Some beaches have chronic bacteria problems that are difficult to solve. However, problems at other beaches are often temporary and quickly resolved and reflect localized problems rather than trends over all in Puget Sound water quality.~P Fortunately, water quality problems at some beaches have been corrected. Sometimes progress is not made because local government lacks funding to conduct Pollution Identification and Correction (PIC) programs. Often times it is very difficult to determine the source of bacterial contamination to a beach.~P Bacteria sources can impact beaches without us knowing there is a problem. For example, when on-site sewage systems serving households fail that are located near beaches. Even when sources of pollution are identified they can be difficult to manage or solve.",
