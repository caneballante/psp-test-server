		"progress-description": "Sediment Quality Triad Index results suggest a mixed portrait of Puget Sound sediment quality. ~SL Five of eight regions and three of six urban bays sampled since 1997 have mean SQTI scores that statistically meet the target value of 81.  Three regions, Hood Canal, the San Juan Islands, and the Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, and three bays, Bainbridge Basin, Bellingham Bay, and Budd Inlet, do not meet the target value. ~B Among eight regions and three bays that were re-sampled from 2004 – 2015, SQTI scores improved in Whidbey Basin, South Sound, the San Juan Islands, and Elliott Bay, but declined in the other seven areas. This decline in SQTI values is primarily due to declines in the number and types of benthic invertebrates, resulting in lower SQTI scores. Two bays, Bellingham Bay and Budd Inlet, for which baseline sampling was first conducted in 2010 and 2011, respectively, also did not meet the SQTI target value due to low numbers and types of benthic invertebrates.~B A third round of sampling was conducted in Elliott Bay in 2013, Commencement Bay in 2014, and Bainbridge Basin in 2015. On a positive note, the SQTI scores exceeded the target value in Elliott Bay and Commencement Bay, with overall improvement in Elliott Bay.  As a result, the 2014 interim targets were all met.  The SQTI score for Bainbridge Basin in 2015, however, declined, fell below the target value, and did not meet the 2016 interim target.  Again, the declining score was due to lower numbers and types of benthic invertebrates.  Toxicity testing was not conducted in Bellingham Bay in 2017, so the SQTI was not evaluated for the 2016 interim target.~EL ~P Did the indicator meet its 2018 interim target? ~SL Five of eight regions sampled between 1997 and 2014 had mean SQTI scores that statistically met or exceeded the target value of 81.  Three of eight were below the target value.  Regional sampling was discontinued after 2014, so no further assessment has been made for regional SQTI values. ~B Toxicity testing was discontinued in urban bays after 2015.  The SQTI will therefore not be reassessed for Budd Inlet in 2018 and Port Gardner/Everett Harbor in 2019.~EL",
		"what": "This indicator is the Sediment Quality Triad Index.~P Much of the floor of Puget Sound is covered with sediments — the gravel, sand, silt, and clay that has accumulated over years, decades, centuries, and even millennia. Sediment quality is a key indicator of a healthy ecosystem, and high-quality sediments support a diverse and important biological community. ~P The Sediment Quality Triad Index (SQTI) measures three aspects of sediment quality in Puget Sound. The SQTI includes: ~P 1) Chemical contamination, as described in the Sediment Chemistry Index (SCI), which is also an indicator for this Vital Sign;~P 2) Toxicity of the sediments to marine life, which measures the combined (synergistic) effects of those chemicals and other sediment characteristics on laboratory test organisms; and ~P 3) Condition of the sediment-dwelling invertebrates, or benthos, including the total number of organisms and total number of species, tolerance or sensitivity of these species to disturbance, and other community indices that reflect the actual biological condition of the sediments as a response to all possible human-caused and natural stressors, whether measured or not. ~P The SQTI combines sediment chemistry, toxicity, and benthos condition indicators into one number, ranging from 1-100, with higher index values indicating higher quality sediments. Methods for calculating the SQTI are described in Dutch et al., 2018, Appendix B.~P <strong>Revisions to the PSEMP Sediment Monitoring Program and Indicators</strong> ~P Ecology’s Marine Sediment Monitoring Team (MSMT) has recently redesigned the Puget Sound Sediment Monitoring Program (Dutch, 2018).  Regional sampling was discontinued in 2014 at the end of the second round of decadal sampling, and toxicity sampling has been scaled back after 2015 to once every 5th year for 50 stations in a Puget Sound-wide sampling frame.  Because of these changes the SQTI will no longer be determined for regions after 2014 or urban bays after 2015.~P While the toxicity portion of the Program has been scaled back, the Program’s focus has broadened to include a wider suite of biological measures and a suite of biogeochemical measures.  New indicators will be developed over time based on these measures, and a revised Benthic Index assessing the condition of the sediment-dwelling invertebrate communities will also be available by 2020.",

We have made the decision to not complete a third round of regional sampling which would have commenced in 2015.  Therefore, there are no further additions to SQTI regional graphics after 2014.~B Ecology’s MSMT has also made the decision to discontinue toxicity testing during annual urban bay work, therefore the SQTI cannot be calculated after 2015, when the last round of toxicity testing was conducted for Bainbridge Basin sediments.~EL"
