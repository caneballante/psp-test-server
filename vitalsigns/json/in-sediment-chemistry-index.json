    "progress-description": "Overall, sediments in eight Puget Sound regions sampled between 1997 and 2014 were in generally good condition with regard to the measured set of chemicals, with the SCI meeting the target value. ~P Five of six urban bays sampled from 2007 through 2018 have also met the target SCI value.  Elliott Bay SCI scores have improved incrementally and significantly between 1998 and 2013, but still do not reach the target value. ~SL Sediment Chemistry Index scores for all regions met or exceeded the target value between 1997 and 2014.  Regional sampling was discontinued after 2014, so no further assessment has been made for regional SCI values. ~B Budd Inlet was resampled in 2018, rather than 2017.  Sample analyses are complete and target conditions for the SCI were met. ~B Port Gardner/Everett Harbor will be resampled in 2019 rather than 2018.  The SCI value cannot yet be evaluated for change over time. ~B Given that sediment contamination generally changes very slowly, we expect most areas currently meeting the target to continue to do so through 2020 unless contaminant inputs to the areas increase. It is possible that the target may be reached in Elliott Bay if conditions there continue to improve.~EL",
	"what": "This indicator is the Sediment Chemistry Index.~P The Sediment Chemistry Index (SCI) is a component of the Sediment Quality Triad Index (SQTI), one of three indicators for this Vital Sign. It combines data on the concentrations of selected chemicals for which state Sediment Quality Standards Chemical Criteria have been set into an overall index of chemical exposure. Contaminants measured that contribute to the SCI include metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and phthalates. ~P Results from other chemicals of concern, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), pesticides, dioxins, furans, endocrine disrupting chemicals, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and perfluorinated chemicals, for which either no state Sediment Quality Standards have been set or measurements were not taken, are not incorporated into the SCI. ~P Tracking the SCI gives an indication of how concentrations of selected chemicals in marine sediments change over time, primarily in response to anthropogenic input, such as stormwater runoff and direct discharge, as well as cleanup activities and passive burial as cleaner sediments settle over older, and sometimes more contaminated, sediments. ~P The SCI ranges from 1-100, with higher index values indicating less exposure to chemicals and thus healthier sediments.  Methods for calculating the SCI are described in Dutch et al., 2018, Appendix B. ~P <strong>Revisions to the PSEMP Sediment Monitoring Program and Indicators</strong> ~P Ecology’s Marine Sediment Monitoring Team (MSMT) has recently redesigned the Puget Sound Sediment Monitoring Program (Dutch, 2018).  Regional sampling was discontinued in 2014 at the end of the second round of decadal sampling.  There will be no further determination of the SCI for regions.  Calculations will continue for sediments collected from six urban bays with a slightly reduced suite of chemicals. ~P The Program’s focus has also been broadened to include a wider suite of biological measures and a suite of biogeochemical measures.  Indicators will be developed over time based on these new measures, and a revised Benthic Index assessing the condition of the sediment-dwelling invertebrate communities will also be available by 2020.",
