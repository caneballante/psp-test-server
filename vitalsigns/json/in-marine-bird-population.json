		"progress-description": "Species in the marine bird indicator are not all displaying the same pattern in abundance.~SL The Puget Sound marbled murrelet population, a federally threatened species, has declined by nearly five percent per year over the past 18 years.~B Scoter (surf, black, and white-winged scoter species combined) density has declined by 2.8 percent per year between 2000 and 2016.  ~B In contrast, the density estimates of pigeon guillemot and rhinoceros auklet have gone up and down year-to-year, but show no trend over the past 18 years.~B Sound-wide trends for pigeon guillemot and rhinoceros auklet are consistent with local-scale monitoring results that generally suggest stable and healthy guillemot and auklet populations in the Puget Sound region. ~B Studies suggest that conservation of suitable nesting habitat is critical to murrelet recovery. In the Puget Sound region, marine factors related to prey abundance and human disturbance also appear to play an important role in changes in murrelet distribution and abundance.~EL",
		"what": "The marine bird population indicator measures population abundance and trends of four bird species that nest or over-winter in the marine environment. The indicator includes:~P 1. Spring/summer at-sea densities of marbled murrelet, rhinoceros auklet and pigeon guillemot. These species are highly dependent on the marine environment of, and breed in, Puget Sound and Strait of Juan de Fuca. ~P 2. At-sea abundance trends of scoter species that over-winter in Puget Sound and Strait of Juan de Fuca. These species are highly dependent on the marine environment of Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but do not breed there. ~P The species selected for this indicator reside in Puget Sound most, if not all, of the year. The indicator provides an integrative view of the health of species that depend upon the Puget Sound for survival, in contrast to the species being indirect indicators of something like habitat quality, contaminants, or prey. ~P The Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) conducts marine bird surveys in the spring/summer months and in January for wintering birds. The spring/summer surveys are boat-based and are part of the Northwest Forest Plan effectiveness monitoring program for the <a href='https://www.fs.fed.us/r6/reo/monitoring/murrelet/'>marbled murrelet</a>. During these surveys, observers also record other species detected. WDFW also conducts winter surveys from airplanes that allow us to assess abundance and trends of scoters and other <a href='http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/01135/'>over-wintering species</a>. ~P The marine bird indicator was officially endorsed by the Science Panel at their April 9, 2014 meeting. The endorsement was based on a peer-reviewed report written jointly by the WDFW and the Puget Sound Partnership. The report, titled <a href='https://www.eopugetsound.org/sites/default/files/features/resources/Pearson%20and%20Hamel%20Bird%20Indicators%202013_Final.pdf'>Marine and Terrestrial Bird Indicators for Puget Sound</a>, develops, presents, and uses a transparent process to identify and evaluate potential indicators and ultimately recommend marine bird indicators. ~P The peer-review process was coordinated by the Puget Sound Partnership Science Panel in 2013. The report was finalized in April of 2014. The indicators were also endorsed by the Leadership Council in January 2014.

				"description": "Sound-wide, the density of pigeon guillemots and rhinoceros auklet has varied from year-to-year, but with no overall trend over the past 18 years. In contrast, the marbled murrelet density has declined by nearly 5% per year over the past 18 years (95% CI = -7.2 to –2.4). In 2018, the population size of marbled murrelets in Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca was estimated at 3,840 birds (95% confidence interval = 1,940 – 6,900 birds). Most of the murrelet population was found in the Admiralty Inlet, San Juan Islands, and Strait of Juan de Fuca regions. Population estimates for the rhinoceros auklet and pigeon guillemot for this same region in 2018 was 27,200 (95% confidence interval = 11,450-39,870) and 7,430 (95% confidence interval = 5,600-9,150) respectively.~P For scoters (surf, black, and white-winged scoter species combined), the density of birds has declined by 2.8% per year between 2000 and 2016. WDFW estimates that there were 65,660 (95% CI =50,000-52,000) scoters (black, surf, & white-winged scoters) in the Salish Sea in 2016. Surveys were not conducted in 2017 but were done again in 2018 with results expected in the near future. ~P More information on the distributions and densities of select marine birds can be found in the <a href='http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=2d7eb8143c3c49679dcf8af25ee20b0a&extent=-127.2413,46.3222,-119.1279,49.3197'>Marine Bird Density Atlas</a>. ~P <strong>REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AND OTHER FACTORS INFORMING THE INDICATORS</strong> ~P <em>Marbled murrelet</em> ~P Although the marbled murrelet spends the vast majority of its life at-sea foraging on fish, it is also dependent on forest habitats where it nests on branches of large trees. The species is federally listed as threatened and is listed as endangered by the state of Washington. To better understand marbled murrelet decline, and to inform conservation planning to recover the species, researchers evaluated how terrestrial and marine factors influenced the distribution and abundance of the murrelet in coastal waters of the U.S. (<a href='https://www.fs.fed.us/r6/reo/monitoring/murrelet/'>link</a>). ~P In 2016, researchers completed a 20-year review of the status and trends of murrelet populations and nesting habitat (<a href='https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/pnw_gtr933.pdf'>link</a>). They found that the murrelet populations in California and Oregon did not exhibit a population trend while the Washington population was declining. They also found that numbers of birds on the water were positively correlated with amounts and pattern (large contiguous patches) of suitable nesting habitat, and that population trend was most strongly correlated with trend in nesting habitat although marine factors also contributed. Their results suggest that conservation of suitable nesting habitat is key to murrelet conservation, but marine factors, especially factors that contribute to murrelet prey abundance, may play a role in murrelet distribution and trend. ~P <em>Rhinoceros auklet</em>"

				"description": "~P Rhinoceros auklets nest in burrows on Smith and Protection Islands in the Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca. <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/protection_island/'>Protection Island</a>, managed jointly by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and WDFW, is a globally important nesting site for rhinoceros auklets with over 35,000 occupied burrows. Peter Hodum (University of Puget Sound), Tom Good (NOAA Fisheries) and Scott Pearson (WDFW) have monitored the colony on Protection Island since 2006. Results indicate that burrow occupancy in 2017 amd 2018 (59% and 65%) was lower than the long-term mean (72 ± 6%; Fig. 2). Hatching success in 2017 and 2018 (88% and 80% of eggs laid) was similar to the long-term mean (85 ± 5.5%; Fig. 2). And, fledging success in 2017 and 2018 (71% and 77%) was similar to the long-term mean (77 ± 11%; Fig. 2). ~P The low occupancy in 2017 and 2018 may be a carryover effect from the unusual rhinoceros auklet mortality event that occurred in 2016.  Fortunately, fledging success appears to have bounced back from its low of 49% in 2016. ~P Over most years, long-term reproductive and population monitoring has been highly consistent across the decades. The exceptionally low fledging success coincided with an unusual number of rhinoceros auklets washing up dead on the beaches in the region (<a href='https://depts.washington.edu/coasst/news/breaking_news/RHAU%20Fact%20Sheet%209Aug16_2.1.pdf'>link</a>). Although the cause of this mortality event are still under investigation, preliminary evidence suggests that bacterial infection was the primary cause of mortality.~P <em>Pigeon guillemot</em>"

				"description": "Pigeon guillemots nest most commonly on cliff faces, crevices among boulders and occassionally under driftwood, or in man-made structures such as wharfs, pipes and bridges (e.g. Hood Canal Bridge). Ongoing citizen-science monitoring by residents of Whidbey Island and South Sound, indicates relatively stable local pigeon guillemot populations. Local population results are consistent with the sound-wide density trends obtained during the spring/summer boat-based surveys. However, it appears that the number of guillemot burrows with chicks was lower in 2018 than in previous years on Whidbey Island, but not in the South Sound. We currently don’t know the mechanism for the lower reproductive success observed on Whidbey Island in 2018. ~P<em>Scoters</em>~P Three scoter species (surf, black and white-winged) over-winter in the Salish Sea. They spend about eight months of the year in this region, with some non-breeding individuals here year-round. While over-wintering, they forage, replace their feathers and put on weight needed to successfully reproduce in high arctic lakes in the summer. Recently published research by Vilchis et al. (2015) indicates that over-wintering species were three times more likely to exhibit population declines in the Salish Sea than local breeders; scoters declined in 9% of the 67 depth/basin strata evaluted between 1994 and 2010. In general, Vilchis et al (2015) found that alcids (species like the marbled murrelet and common murre) and sea ducks (species like the scoters) dominated the over-wintering bird community during the 1990s, whereas non-diving bird species and diving species with diverse diets dominated the wintering bird community in the 2000s."
