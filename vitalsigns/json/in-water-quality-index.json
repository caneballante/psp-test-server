		"progress-description": "Between 1997 and 2017, there was no clear upward or downward trend in the freshwater Water Quality Index. Thus, progress toward the 2020 target for this indicator is categorized as ‘not improving’.~SL The baseline is the percentage of stations established in 2008 (31 in total) where the average Water Quality Index score was at or above the target value of 80 over the 5-year period from 2008-2012 (35%). ~B There has been no progress toward the 2020 target for the Water Quality Index. Only 33% of monitored stations were at or above the target value of 80, on average, from 2013 to 2017. This percentage is slightly lower than the baseline reference established for the period 2008-2012 (35%), but the difference is not significant.~EL",
		"what": "Clean freshwater is vital to people and to fish and wildlife populations. When rivers and streams pick up pollutants, toxic contaminants, or excessive sediments and nutrients, the health of watersheds, marine waters, swimming beaches, and shellfish beds are adversely affected.~P The Water Quality Index for rivers and streams combines eight measures of water quality. Four of the component measures (dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and fecal coliform bacteria) are tied to the State’s Water Quality Standards for protecting aquatic life and contact recreation. The other four measures (nitrogen, phosphorus, suspended sediment, and turbidity) do not have numeric standards, although they are related to general ecosystem function. A higher number is indicative of better water quality.~P Index values are based on monthly monitoring at individual stations. The index values range from 1 to 100; a higher number is indicative of better water quality. However, a particular station may receive a good Water Quality Index score, and yet have water quality impaired by parameters not included in the index. Similarly, some locations may have poor Water Quality Index scores based on measures that do not have Water Quality Standards. ~P In general, stations scoring 80 and above meet expectations for water quality according to Washington State Standards for surface water quality (Chapter 173-201A WAC). Water Quality Index scores between 40 and 80 indicate water quality is marginal, and scores below 40 do not meet expectations. For measures without established criteria, a score of 80 indicates conditions were better than 20 percent of results collected during an historical benchmark period.~P The Washington State Department of Ecology, King County, and other jurisdictions monitor 31 long-term monitoring stations across Puget Sound watersheds. These stations are located along rivers and streams, from the mouth of the rivers to further upstream toward the headwaters. The Puget Sound Partnership’s target data come from these 31 stations. Since 2008, the number of stations monitored each year has ranged from 26 to 31, depending on the availability of funding and resources.",

				"description": "In 2017, 27 stations were monitored for water quality, 41% of which were at or above the target value of 80. Between 2013 and 2017, only 33% of the stations monitored had exceeded a Water Quality Index score of 80.~P Average Water Quality Index scores for major rivers in Puget Sound with long-term monitoring have ranged from the mid-60s to high-70s between 1997 and 2017 (Figure 1). Annual results show a slight improving trend in WQI scores of >0.31 units per year (p<0.10) since 1997. Variability in WQI scores have also decreased since 1997 at a rate of >4.0 units per year (p<0.01).~P In addition to some improvements in the overall mean annual scores since 1997 for major rivers in Puget Sound, fecal coliform bacteria (.24 units per year) and total nitrogen index scores (.27 units per year) also improved (p<0.05).  Furthermore, there are some slight reductions in mean annual stream temperature and total suspended sediment concentration on a few systems. However, Puget Sound-wide trends in index scores for other measures were not significant."

		"why-happening": "Results from the trend analysis of 16 major rivers since 1997 suggest that there has been very little change in overall water quality at the vast majority of sites. That said, Water Quality Index scores do demonstrate some improvements in certain measures of freshwater quality since 1997 for major rivers in Puget Sound. Specifically, fecal coliform bacteria and total nitrogen index scores have improved as well as some slight reductions in mean annual stream temperature and total suspended sediment concentration on a few systems. However, Puget Sound-wide trends for other measures were not significant. ~P In terms of classifying overall water quality on individual Puget Sound stream systems, two river systems show some improving trends that are significant, the Nisqually River and Deschutes River. However, due to the slow rate of improvements in overall Puget Sound water quality trends, the Partnership’s recovery target is not likely to be reached by 2020.~P The earliest projection for meeting the target value for these 16 rivers would be 2025. When adjusted for differences in seasonal flows, the trend is much slower: average flow-adjusted scores of 80 are projected for 2060. Flow-adjusting accounts for the effect of flow on the parameters underlying the index.~P Our projection to and beyond 2020 is a best guess. Predictions are difficult due to fluctuations in drivers like the rate of population growth, global warming, and effectiveness of management activities, as well as possible long-term cycles not visible in the current 20-year dataset (1997-2017). For example, management tends to address the easier and more egregious problems first. As those problems get fixed, remaining problems become more difficult to correct with less effect on the water body for a given level of effort. Consequently, the rate of improvement in the index could be less, perhaps much less, than predicted by simply extending current trends.",
