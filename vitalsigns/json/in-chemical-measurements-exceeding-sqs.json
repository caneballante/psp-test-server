		"progress-icon-tagline": "Yes, this indicator has made gains relative to the baseline reference.",
		"progress-description": "Although the target is not fully met across all of Puget Sound, improvements suggest progress toward the target:~SL Regionally, the percent of individual chemicals exceeding SQS between 1997 and 2014 is small, with the value only exceeding one percent in Central Sound. ~B Values declined in six of eight regions during the second round of sampling, with those in Hood Canal, the Strait of Georgia, South Sound, and the San Juan Islands meeting the target of zero percent. ~B Regional sampling was discontinued after 2014, so no further assessment has been made for regional SQS Index values.~B The percent of individual chemicals exceeding SQS in Elliott Bay and Commencement Bay were higher than measurements collected elsewhere, but declined between 1998 and 2014.  Values calculated for Bainbridge Basin in 2015 remain unchanged between 1998 and 2015.~B Budd Inlet and the Port Gardner/Everett Harbor urban embayments were at zero in 2011 and 2012, respectively, while Bellingham Bay sediments dropped to zero between 2010 and 2017.  Budd Inlet remained at zero in 2018.~B Given that sediment contamination generally changes very slowly, we expect most areas currently meeting the target to continue to do so through 2020 unless contaminant inputs to the areas increase. It is possible that the target may be reached in Elliott Bay and Commencement Bay if conditions continue to improve. ~EL",
		"what": "This indicator is Sediment Quality Standards Index.~P This indicator is the percent of individual chemical measurements that exceed the Washington Sediment Quality Standards (SQS).  It is related to the Sediment Chemistry Index, another indicator for the Marine Sediment Quality Vital Sign. ~P SQS values have been determined for a total of 47 chemicals in Puget Sound. Of those, 34 are included in the calculation of this indicator.  Contaminants measured that contribute to the SQS Index include metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and phthalates. ~P Results from other chemicals of concern, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), pesticides, dioxins, furans, endocrine disrupting chemicals, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and perfluorinated chemicals, for which no state SQS have been set, are not incorporated into the SQS Index.~P <strong>Revisions to the PSEMP Sediment Monitoring Program and Indicators</strong> ~P Ecology’s Marine Sediment Monitoring Team (MSMT) has recently redesigned the Puget Sound Sediment Monitoring Program (Dutch, 2018).  Regional sampling was discontinued in 2014 at the end of the second round of decadal sampling.  There will be no further determination of the SQS Index for regions.  Calculations will continue for sediments collected from six urban bays with a slightly reduced suite of chemicals. Five chemicals which have generally been undetected in the sediments were recently dropped from the suite of chemicals monitored by the program, and thus, from the SQS Index calculations. ~P The Program’s focus has been broadened to include a wider suite of biological measures and a suite of biogeochemical measures.  New indicators will be developed over time based on these measures, and a revised Benthic Index assessing the condition of the sediment-dwelling invertebrate communities will also be available by 2020.",
